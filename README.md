## Agent Discovery

This site supports modern agent discovery protocols to help AI agents (like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity) understand its structure and services:

- **llms.txt**: Found at [/llms.txt](/public/llms.txt), providing a machine-readable summary of the site's content and intent.
- **Link Headers**: Discovery headers are served on the homepage to point agents to the `llms.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- **DNS-AID**: Support for DNS-based AI Discovery via HTTPS/SVCB records. See [DNS_AID.md](DNS_AID.md) for configuration details.
